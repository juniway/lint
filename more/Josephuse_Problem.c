/*
n prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered from 0 to n âˆ’ 1.
An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner 0, removing every k-th prisoner and killing him.
As the process goes on, the circle becomes smaller and smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is then freed.

For example, if there are n = 5 prisoners and k = 2,
the order the prisoners are killed in (let's call it the "killing sequence")
will be 1, 3, 0, and 4, and the survivor will be #2.

Task Given any n,k > 0, find out which prisoner will be the final survivor.
In one such incident, there were 41 prisoners and every 3rd prisoner was being killed (k = 3).
Among them was a clever chap name Josephus who worked out the problem, stood at the surviving position,
and lived on to tell the tale. Which number was he?
